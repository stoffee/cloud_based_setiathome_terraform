# Deploy Seti at Home in the Cloud or Pay4Seti

- Got some free credits you want to waste?
- Looking for a different way to GIVE this year?

This will deploy a [Seti@Home](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/) server in the cloud of your choice with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

That server will then churn at [100% until you turn it off](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/top_hosts.php).

### You will be putting your $$$ into a big internet tube that shoots that money out into space to search for life!
